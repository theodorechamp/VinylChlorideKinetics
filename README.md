## Documentation

The vector pp is vector of partial pressures of species at this moment.
The entries of pp are below:
pp(1) = c2h4
pp(2) = hcl
pp(3) = o2
pp(4) = 1,1,2-trichloroethane
pp(5) = co2
pp(6) = cl2
pp(7) = 1,2-dichloroethane
pp(8) = h2o

The vector k is a vector of kinetic constants for rate expressions.
Index values align with drawn flowchart on google docs
